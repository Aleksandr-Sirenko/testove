              The key reason I love IT-Rating is that it’s a quite complex but at the same time very intuitive service. If you're an IT company looking for employees or new customers, this is the platform you need. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I highly appreciate their methodology when sponsorship is not the same as the company's rating position. It makes companies think about the quality of their services much more.

              Taking part in digital marketing agencies contests has always seemed tricky for us. Quite often, agencies are being judged not by the quality of their work but by their website design or their clients’ popularity. However, this is completely biased and unfair as there are a lot of fraud agencies that present someone else’s case studies or results as their own. Thanks to the IT Rating platform, we are sure that all our competitors have confirmed their portfolios in an automated mode, and that the ranking is based not on biased assessments but on objective data and facts.

              We decided to use IT-Rating as a data directory for reaching new customers. This was after trying Clutch and some other similar platforms. The best thing I love about IT-Rating is that its ratings are automated and based on transparent algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
              They also have a very amiable team that can answer any questions about the platform and the customers' abilities. It makes their service easy to start and use.

              We have been cooperating with IT rating USA for quite a long time, and we are more than satisfied with the cooperation.
            </p>
            <p>
              First of all, I want to note the great variability of advertising formats, thanks to which you can choose several of the best options and combine them into one package. It is very convenient and profitable.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also want to note the very responsive support. For example, we wanted to change the creatives, and we got it done very quickly. The guys have always been very efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the last purchase of advertising received a nice bonus. Even after the end of the advertising period, it was left for the weekend.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will definitely continue to cooperate in the future.

              At the beginning of 2019, our company had an urgent need for
              development team in connection with the expansion of the service package and product line.
              At that time, finding and hiring workers in Israel was not an easy task,
              time-consuming and, frankly, quite costly.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was decided to start looking for a team in the Balkans and the countries of the former CIS. studying
              offers for Ukraine, we used the IT rating as a kind of guide
              by companies, because it was easy and quick to see reviews and
              ensure the quality of services in the presented portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
              Honestly, it was a little scary to rely on unfamiliar companies, and even in
              country that you have never been to before. But having outlined a few
              potential partners, a week later we flew to get acquainted in person.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the moment, we have already doubled the number of employees and very
              We have been successfully cooperating so far. We plan to further expand
              your staff in other directions using ITRating, which yourself
              highly recommended.

              We often use the services of advertising on the IT Rating, as we get the bulk of the leads from it
