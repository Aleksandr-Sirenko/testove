            IT ratings are a great tool for promoting IT businesses and finding the best contractors for different types of tasks. We specialize in composing highly trustworthy ratings, backed up by substantial qualitative and quantitative data.</p>
            <h2>
            What Is it-rating.com and How It Can Help You</h2>
            <p>
            We compose ratings of IT companies from various niches. We strive to be as impartial as possible. We've developed a unique methodology that enables us to honestly rate IT companies by a set of meaningful criteria. Our ratings come in handy for both IT companies and people who'd like to use their services.</p>
            <p>
            Our ratings include only the information that we can check. For instance, an IT agency might state that it has completed a certain number of cases, using specific frameworks. Before taking this statement into account, we need to see with our own eyes that these facts are true.</p>
            <p>
            We can boast an essential competitive edge: our rating features an Al-based recommendation algorithm. You start to search for what you need and the system will remember your requirements. Based on the gathered data, our rating will offer the best stack technologies, resources, and companies to you.</p>
            <p>
            Our mission is not limited to providing our clients with access to top professionals. We strive to build digital ecosystems. Such ecosystems are characterized by a high level of partnership and offer a complex of essential and convenient services. This approach encourages competition among IT agencies and motivates them for ongoing development.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
              An integral part of our ecosystem is IT news that we regularly publish on our website. Besides, we carry out a lot of independent research in the IT sphere and we share the results of our work with our clients. It's your chance to get to know about industry trends and discover insightful statistics.</li>
              <li>
              You can run tenders for contractors on our website. In this format, it will be very convenient for you to compare the offers of various agencies. It's much easier than receiving their files with miscellaneous data on your email.</li>
              <li>
              On our website, IT companies post job vacancies to find staff with the necessary skills and experience. You can post yours as well as find a good job.</li>
              <li>
              Plus, you can get to know which specialists work for a specific company. The system allows you to check which of them have projects in their portfolios that are similar to the one that you'd like to complete.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            We welcome all sorts of users to our ecosystem. Not only directors and top managers can join our network but also professionals who're making their first steps in the field. We target our content at customers with different levels of expertise. We hope the information from our website will help you grow and develop.</p>
            <h3>
            How Can Businesses and Private Users Who Need Contractors Benefit from IT Company Ratings</h3>
            <p>
            The competition in the IT sector is fierce. When you need a contractor to build a mobile app or carry out the SEO optimization for your website, you may use search engines or the information from ads. But you should realize that any random company can pay for its ads or search engine optimization. These two channels don't give you any guarantee of this business's quality of work.</p>
            <p>
            An alternative way out is to ask your friends and colleagues for recommendations. But they might lack the relevant contacts. Or, they might recommend you a mediocre company (even though they were happy with its services).</p>
            <p>
            The safest and the quickest way of detecting a perfect contractor is using an IT rating:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
              You can be sure that only reliable and professional companies are included in the rating.</li>
              <li>
              Top ratings are accompanied by short comprehensive guides that will explain to you how to use them.</li>
              <li>
              You'll be able to filter the listed companies by the parameters that matter to you.</li>
              <li>
              The system will enable you to check the criteria that determined the company's position in the rating.</li>
              <li>
              You'll get to know about top contractors that are located far away from you but are ready to work with clients from your region. An IT rating in the USA might feature businesses from other regions that charge less than their American counterparts.</li>
              <li>
              Ratings provide the main facts about each company in a well-structured format. You can compare the prices on one page.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            In a nutshell, you'll save a lot of time and nerves if you use our rating. You won't need to pay for a loot box â€” that is, purchase the services of a provider whom you hardly know anything about.</p>
            <p>
            It's impossible to improve a company's position in the rating by paying its authors. Only hard work and the impeccable quality of the ready products can impact the position of an IT business.</p>
            <h3>
            How IT Companies Can Benefit from an IT Rating</h3>
            <p>
            IT companies should make sure they're featured in the most important ratings for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
              When potential clients and other professionals from the industry see you in a rating, they understand that you're serious about your business.</li>
              <li>
              It's an excellent way of proving the highest quality of your services.</li>
              <li>
              Thanks to ratings, you can easily find new customers, partners, investors or employees.</li>
              <li>
              By comparing your company to your competitors, you'll be able to find out which aspects of your workflows you need to improve.</li>
              <li>
              People trust ratings more than ads. By using this promotional tool, you can optimize your marketing budget.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            We keep constantly adding new companies to our rating. Feel free to get in touch with us to add yours, if it's not there yet!</p>
            <h3>
            Methodology of Our IT Companies Rating</h3>
            <p>
            The methodology that we rely on is simple and transparent:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
              We start with assessing an IT company's age and portfolio. We calculate how many websites this business has developed, promoted, and/or supported. The more of them there is, the better.</li>
              <li>
              We analyze the traffic of these sites and their authority indexes from the point of view of search engines. The more intense the traffic and the higher the authority indexes, the more impressive the business's position in our rating.</li>
              <li>
              Then, we check the company's awards and customer reviews. Ideally, the business should have a lot of meaningful awards and many positive reviews from clients that genuinely exist.</li>
              <li>
              If a company verifies itself on our website, it will give it a considerable boost.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            For each criterion, we give the business a certain number of points. The number of points can be positive or negative. For instance, negative feedback decreases the total number of points.</p>
            <h3>
